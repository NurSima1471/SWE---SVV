# Java Number Checker

This is a simple Java console application that checks whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero.  
If the input is not a valid number, the program notifies the user.

## How it works:
- The user is asked to enter a number.
- The program checks:
  - If the number is positive → prints "This number is positive."
  - If the number is negative → prints "This number is negative."
  - If the number is zero → prints "This number is zero."
  - If the input is not a valid number → prints a warning message.

## Technologies
- Java
- Scanner class for user input
- Try-catch block for input validation
